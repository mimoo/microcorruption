# Level 8: Johannesburg

## Quick Look

There is now a security against passwords that exceed a certain number of letters, but the security happens after storing it in stack so we can still store a longer password than expected. The maximum possible seems to be 37bytes. But the last `ret` is avoided by a `br` (branch to destination) and the program is shut down early, so no stack overflow here.
