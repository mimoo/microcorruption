# Level 7: Whitehorse

## Quick look

We quickly test our program and see that we can enter a password of maximum 48bytes and that we have a **stack overflow** after a length of 16 bytes.

The Program jumps to the address located in the bytes number 17 and 18 of our password, this occurs after the Interrupt that checks our password. 

## Where should we jump?

The program uses HSM-2 to check the password. We don't have access to it. In the LockIT Pro **Manual** we can read:

>**INT 0x7F.**
>Interface with deadbolt to trigger an unlock if the password is correct.
>Takes no arguments

We just have to call an 0x7F interrupt. To tell that to the program we have to simulate the `push #0x7F` so that the interrupt would work.

If we enter this password: *aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa60447f*

When the `ret` will occurs, it will put 4460 inside `pc` and points the Stack Pointer `sp` to the value 7f. That's exactly what we want, and it works.
