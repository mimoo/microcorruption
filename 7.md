# Level 7: Montevideo

## Quick Look

We can enter a 3x16bytes password (same as previous level).
The program uses strcpy and memset (this is new).
We have a stack overflow after 16 bytes (like the previous level).
So let's try entering the exact same password *aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa60447f*.

It works...
