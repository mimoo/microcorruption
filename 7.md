# Level 7: Whitehorse

## Observations

We quickly test our program and see that we can enter a password of maximum 48 bytes and that we have a **stack overflow** after a length of 16 bytes.

The Program jumps to the address located in the bytes number 17 and 18 of our password, this occurs after the Interrupt that checks our password. 

## Where should we jump?

The program uses **HSM-2** to check the password. We don't have access to it. In the **LockIT Pro Manual** we can read:

> **INT 0x7F.**
> Interface with deadbolt to trigger an unlock if the password is correct.
> Takes no arguments

We just have to call a **0x7F interrupt**. To tell that to the program we have to simulate the `push #0x7F` so that the interrupt would work.

If we enter this password: `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa60447f`

When the `ret` will occurs, it will set the Program Counter to `4460` (where the Stack Pointer is). Then the SP will move to the value `7f` which will be taken as an argument when the interrupt will happen. That's exactly what we want, and it works.
