## Observations

* ASLR is used. The stack and the .text section are at random addresses 

>  ASLR involves randomly arranging the positions of key data areas of a program, including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap, and libraries, in a process's address space.

* The .text gets copied with memcpy at location in r13. Then we call r13.
* Then we seem to be executing the function `_aslr_main`.

## What can we do ?

Let's see what our input influence first.
if we enter long inputs we get an error. So we have an overflow as well.
